# Conda (high level overview)

`conda` is a language-agnostic package manager and environment management system. `conda`'s environment management functionality makes it possible for a user to easily switch between **environments** (where an **environment** consists of the hardware and software used to execute code) and makes it possible to export a specification of that environment that can be used to reproduce that environment on another system.

`conda`'s package manager allows you to install and use packages developed in any language(s), and it will perform some checks to ensure that a package version and its dependencies are compatible with your environment before installing them. To facilitate use of packages written in any language, developers of `conda` packages have to [specify](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/concepts/pkg-specs.html) a **recipe** for building the package for specific systems (which includes at least a [meta.yaml](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda-build/en/latest/resources/define-metadata.html?highlight=binary) file and potentially build scripts with instructions on how to build the package for a given target system). This meta.yaml recipe file is where the developer specifies the package's dependencies. The package developer can test their recipe by using `conda build` to [build](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda-build/en/latest/concepts/recipe.html#conda-build-process) their package. When the package developer is content with their package recipe, they can submit that package recipe to a `conda` **channel** (or package listing and distribution platforms). Default channels (like `anaconda` and `R`) are maintained by Anaconda, Inc. and don't accept user submitted packages, but there are community maintained channels like [conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org) or [bioconda](https://bioconda.github.io/) that do accept user submitted packages (although they have their own submission processes), and technically anyone can create a conda channel (private or public).
